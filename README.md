# Homekit_Party_Lights
A work-in-progress party light for Homekit!
Go back to [Will's Homekit stuff](https://github.com/Frostist/Wills-Homekit-Stuff)

It uses a NeoPixel LED strip and puts on the rainbow effect when the button is pushed!

Pin Output 2 can be changed as well as the length of the strip!
